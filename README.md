# Imagine if my system, was at hand?
Well, not quite. Basically, it is! With sudo, and passwd [password] changing, you can manipluate anything. Sure sure, you can do this on your own system. But come on, **it's quick and easy!**. 

## Steps to install

Install gnome-terminal via your package managing service.
```sudo apt install gnome-terminal [arguments here if needed. mainly a version]```
```sudo dpkg [arguments]```
```sudo yum [arguments]```

And others.
Just to make sure, install **[python3]**.
```sudo apt install python3 [arguments here if needed. version i dont think is needed.]```
```sudo dpkg [arguments]```
```sudo yum [arguments]```

Also, install pip or pipx, or just use the python3 tutorial provided python3 packages to install Python's subprocess. I will explain.
Use ```sudo apt install python3-package``` where the package is your python3 package. Now, we turn that package demonstation into subprocess.
```sudo apt install python3-subprocess```. It could be already installed on your system.
Or pipx:
```pipx install subprocess``` 
Pip:
```pip install subprocess```

Easy as **pie**!


Run the script now,
```python3 systemathand.py```

- Funny that, the name system at hand is syste**math**and. LOL!

  Make sure you don't do any of these things:

  - Illegally hack anything on your system.
  - Also, any changes may void warranty.
 
    There you have it!
